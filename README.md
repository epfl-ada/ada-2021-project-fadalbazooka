## Recent trends in gender issues in a global context : seeking for contrasted opinions

### Abstract

Gender norms are social principles that govern the behavior of all of us in society and restrict our gender identity into what is considered to be appropriate. These are neither static nor universal and change over time, and can result in inequalities. 

More and more countries have recently legalized and recognized same-sex marriage, sometimes following long legal procedures. In Switzerland, this law was introduced in 2013, passed in 2020 by the parliament and adopted by referendum in September 2021.
The feminism topic also indicates real changes in society. LGBT+ issues are also extremely present in public life, with emerging pride movements and pure gender questioning.

We will focus on observing changes in the speakersâ€™ opinion on the topics of gender equality and same-sex relations, depending on their nationality, age, as well as possibly occupation, and quote date. It is also of interest to compare opinions within countries before and after national events, such as same-sex marriage legalization.



### Research Questions:

- How legalization of same-sex marriage influenced the opinion of the authors of the quotes?
- Which countries' opinions significantly contrast with others ?
- Does the author's age significantly lead to different trends, i.e. does the youngest authors generally have broader gender norms - Do our sentiment analysis of gender equality opinion per country matches with related indexes (European Institute for Gender Equality https://eige.europa.eu/gender-equality-index/2021 or United Nations Development Program - Human Development Report - Gender Inequality Index http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/gender-inequality-index-gii for example) ?


### Additional datasets

We do not plan to use any additional datasets than the one provided for the outlook of this project.
The Wikidata was however used to have access to the speaker's attributes such as their nationality, gender, or age.


### Methods

First of all, in order to handle the dataset which is really heavy, we had to do some data pre-processing steps. 

### Proposed timeline


### Organization within the team: A list of internal milestones up until project Milestone 3.

### Questions for TAs (optional): Add here any questions you have for us related to the proposed project.
